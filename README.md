A case study from [Google Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) offered by Coursera.

As a data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, as a member of the marketing analyst team, I want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

ABOUT CYCLISTIC
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.

One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who buy annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

BUSINESS TASK?

To help meet Cyclistic Business objectives, these questions will guide the future marketing program;

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

**DATA PREPARATION**
Cyclistic previous [12 months' trip](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) data was downloaded. Structured and third-party data made available by Motivate International Inc under the license of [Divvybikes](https://divvybikes.com/)

I ensured the data is free from bias and credible to work on. Ensured each dataset is reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited.

I have taken a thorough and thoughtful approach to selecting and working with the data, with a focus on ensuring quality, accuracy, and integrity.

**DATA PREPROCESSING AND CLEANING**

**Skill- Python. Libraries- Pandas, Numpy. Tool- Jupyter Notebook**

I will be working with 12 months of data to get actionable insights. After downloading 12 months of datasets from the cloud database in CSV files format CSV stands for "Comma-Separated Values". It is a simple file format used for storing tabular data. I will use Python skills to process my datasets, merge the datasets to one full year, and clean my dataset for null values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers before processing to analyzing stage.

Importing each CSV files into my Jupyter Notebook on my local machine. Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows me to create and share interactive documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. It supports many programming languages, including Python which I will be using throughout my work. First import needed packages. Pandas is a Python package for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures for efficiently storing and working with tabular, labeled, and relational data. The second package, NumPy is a Python package for scientific computing and numerical analysis.
